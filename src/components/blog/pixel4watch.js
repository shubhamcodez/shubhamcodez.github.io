    <h2>Google Pixel 4 : Review</h2>
    <p><em>Published on November 29, 2025</em></p>

    <p>Over the past few weeks, the <strong>Pixel 4 Watch</strong> has quietly become the most personal piece of tech I own. It’s not just a smartwatch—it feels like a mini wellness coach, accountability partner, and productivity assistant wrapped into one sleek device.</p>

    <p>I’m walking more. I’m sleeping better. And I’m paying real attention to my heart rate during workouts instead of guessing. Here’s why it works so well.</p>

    <h3>What Makes It My Daily Essential</h3>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li><strong>Accurate Step Tracking:</strong> Even during indoor workouts, the watch tracks movement with precision. This alone helped boost my daily step count by <em>15%</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Heart-Rate Monitoring:</strong> It keeps me in the proper training zone during workouts and nudges me when I push too hard or too little.</li>
      <li><strong>Sleep Insights:</strong> It breaks down sleep into light, deep, and REM cycles, then scores your night in a simple, motivating way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Battery Life & Charging</h3>
    <p>I expected average battery life, but the Pixel 4 Watch surprised me:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li><strong>24-hour</strong> battery with always-on display</li>
      <li><strong>Fast charging</strong> that gives a full day’s power in about 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This alone removes one of the biggest frustrations I’ve had with wearables.</p>

    <h3>Smart Features Worth Highlighting</h3>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li><strong>Google Assistant:</strong> Perfect for quick commands—timers, texts, reminders, you name it.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Maps:</strong> Turn-by-turn navigation on your wrist is more convenient than it looks.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Wallet:</strong> Tap-to-pay is instant and surprisingly addictive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design & Comfort</h3>
    <p>The Pixel 4 Watch is lightweight, minimal, and comfortable enough to forget you’re wearing it. The Roboto-inspired interface is clean and the OLED screen is bright outdoors but soft at night.</p>

    <h3>Final Verdict</h3>
    <p>The Pixel 4 Watch isn’t just another smartwatch—it’s a health-first lifestyle companion that blends beautifully into your day. If you’re someone who wants actionable health insights, a polished Android experience, and a clean design, it’s absolutely worth considering.</p>

    <h3>Should You Buy It?</h3>
    <p>If you want a stylish, reliable smartwatch that helps improve your habits and integrates seamlessly with Google’s ecosystem, the Pixel 4 Watch is a fantastic choice.</p>
