    <h2>The Running Man (2025) Review</h2>
    <p><em>Published on December 13, 2025</em></p>
    <p><strong>My Rating:</strong> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ <strong>7/10</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Directed by:</strong> Edgar Wright</p>
    <p><strong>Starring:</strong> Glen Powell, Josh Brolin, Colman Domingo, Lee Pace, Michael Cera, Katy O'Brian, Jayme Lawson</p>
    <p><strong>Released:</strong> November 2025</p>
    
    <p>Edgar Wright's 2025 adaptation of Stephen King's dystopian novel <em>The Running Man</em> is a great movie with a refreshing concept that feels incredibly timely. Glen Powell stars as Ben Richards, a desperate working-class father whose young daughter is seriously ill and in need of expensive treatment. In this near-future America, the all-powerful "Network" controls the media, the economy, and the narratives people see—essentially dictating what the public believes while the rich exploit the poor and devalue their lives.</p>
    
    <p>Ben reluctantly joins The Running Man, the Network's flagship deadly game show run by their propaganda channel. Contestants (Runners) have 30 days to survive while being hunted by professional killers and incentivized civilians who can earn rewards for reporting or taking them down. However, Ben's initial motivation—saving his sick daughter—feels like it falls short in relevance because Josh Brolin's character, the slick producer Dan Killian, essentially ragebaits him into fully committing to the game.</p>
    
    <p>The movie was great overall, but what I didn't like was how it was advertised as the entire world trying to hunt him down in a relentless frenzy. In reality, most of the film—even when audience support isn't fully behind him—focuses more on evasion from the professional Hunters and only occasional civilian threats. Not a lot of people are actively hunting him down the way the marketing hyped it up, which made some parts feel less chaotic than expected.</p>
    
    <p>Michael Cera's character (Elton, a quirky rebel ally) was great—entertaining, fun, and brought some unexpected humor and heart to the story. He gets killed off in the most unexpected way, which hits hard and stands out as one of the film's most memorable moments.</p>
    
    <p>The supporting performances are strong across the board. Josh Brolin is perfectly chilling as Dan Killian, the manipulative producer. Colman Domingo energizes the screen as the smarmy host, and Lee Pace is imposing as the lead Hunter. The action is visceral, with inventive chases and confrontations that keep the tension high, blending practical stunts with Wright's kinetic style.</p>
    
    <p>The film's climax seems weirdly written too, with a lot of scenes leading up to it feeling anticlimactic or uneven. Some stretches drag a bit amid the otherwise fast pace.</p>
    
    <h3>Major Spoilers Ahead:</h3>
    <p>As Ben gets close to surviving the full 30 days and gathers massive public support from viewers watching the show, he's captured. Killian contacts him, ragebaiting him again by falsely claiming the Hunters killed his family to give him extra motivation. He offers Ben a Hunter position if he kills all the current Hunters. These ragebait-induced actions feel a bit stupid for such a smart, resourceful character like Ben, but he goes along with it and takes out the Hunters.</p>
    
    <p>Afterward, he's offered the position again, but refuses. So Killian manipulates the narrative, portraying Ben as the villain. The Network broadcasts fake footage of Ben threatening to crash a hijacked plane into their headquarters, then announces they've shot it down—making the audience think he died as a terrorist.</p>
    
    <p>But it's later revealed he escaped through an ejection system (or cockpit security in some descriptions), survives, reunites with his family (who were safe all along), and joins a growing public revolution from the poor against the increasing societal imbalances. The tone culminates in uprising and hope for change, exposing the Network's corruption on live TV.</p>
    
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Overall, this is a refreshing take on a dystopian story with strong undertones of how the rich play and control the poor, manipulate media and narratives, and don't value lower-class lives. It's adrenaline-fueled entertainment with real social commentary on class divides and spectacle-driven distraction. Wright stays closer to King's book than the 1987 version, but opts for a more optimistic revolution over total despair.</p>
    
    <p>Even with the pacing issues, anticlimactic build-ups, and the hype vs. reality mismatch on the "world hunting him" aspect, it's highly watchable and thought-provoking. However, the film had some stupid moments that detracted from the overall experience. A solid <strong>7/10</strong> for me—definitely worth seeing, but not without its flaws.</p>
