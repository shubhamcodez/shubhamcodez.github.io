    <h2>Representing NYU Tandon at Grace Hopper Celebration 2024</h2>
    <p><em>Published on October 5, 2024</em></p>

    <p>This fall, I had the honor of representing NYU Tandon at the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) 2024, one of the largest gatherings of women technologists in the world. The experience was both inspiring and humbling, as I engaged with students, professionals, and leaders committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in technology.</p>

    <h3>About Grace Hopper Celebration</h3>
    <p>GHC is the world's largest gathering of women technologists, bringing together students, researchers, and professionals from across the tech industry. The conference celebrates the achievements of women in computing and provides a platform for networking, learning, and career development.</p>

    <p>Named after Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral, the conference embodies her spirit of innovation, determination, and breaking barriers in technology.</p>

    <h3>My Role as NYU Tandon Representative</h3>
    <p>As a representative of NYU Tandon, I had the opportunity to:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li>Engage with prospective students interested in NYU's programs</li>
      <li>Share insights about NYU Tandon's academic offerings and research opportunities</li>
      <li>Connect with current students and encourage them to consider NYU for their graduate studies</li>
      <li>Participate in discussions about advancing diversity in technology</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <p>GHC 2024 reinforced the importance of creating inclusive environments in technology. The conference showcased incredible talent and innovation from women across all areas of computing—from AI and machine learning to systems engineering and quantitative finance.</p>

    <p>One of the most valuable aspects was connecting with students at various stages of their careers. Many were exploring graduate programs, considering career transitions, or seeking mentorship. Being able to share my own journey and provide guidance was deeply rewarding.</p>

    <h3>The Impact of Representation</h3>
    <p>Representing NYU Tandon at GHC highlighted the role that institutions and individuals play in advancing diversity in technology. By actively participating in events like GHC, we can help create pathways for underrepresented groups in tech and demonstrate that the field is open to everyone.</p>

    <p>The conversations I had with students showed how important visibility and representation are. Seeing someone from your institution actively engaging in diversity initiatives sends a powerful message about institutional values and commitment.</p>

    <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
    <p>GHC 2024 was a reminder that advancing diversity in technology requires ongoing commitment and action. As I continue my career in quantitative finance and AI, I'm committed to supporting initiatives that make technology more inclusive and accessible.</p>

    <p>I'm grateful to NYU Tandon for the opportunity to represent the institution at such an important event, and I look forward to continuing to support GHC's mission of empowering women in technology.</p>
