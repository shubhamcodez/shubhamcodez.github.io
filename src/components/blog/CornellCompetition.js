    <h2>Top 5 Finish at Cornell Competition: Market Making, Estimatathon, Trading, and Prediction Markets</h2>
    <p><em>Published on March 15, 2024</em></p>

    <p>Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to participate in the Cornell Competition, a multi-faceted quantitative finance competition that tested skills across market making, estimatathon, trading, and prediction markets. I'm thrilled to share that I placed in the top 5 across all games—an achievement that reflects both preparation and adaptability in competitive quantitative environments.</p>

    <h3>The Competition Structure</h3>
    <p>The Cornell Competition was unique in its breadth, covering four distinct areas of quantitative finance:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li><strong>Market Making:</strong> Managing bid-ask spreads and inventory risk in dynamic market conditions</li>
      <li><strong>Estimatathon:</strong> Making accurate probabilistic estimates under uncertainty</li>
      <li><strong>Trading:</strong> Developing and executing trading strategies in competitive markets</li>
      <li><strong>Prediction Markets:</strong> Pricing and trading on future events and outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
    <p>What made this competition particularly valuable was the diversity of skills it required. Market making demanded real-time risk management and inventory control. The estimatathon challenged my ability to calibrate probabilities and think clearly under uncertainty. Trading required quick decision-making and strategy adaptation. Prediction markets tested my understanding of information aggregation and efficient market dynamics.</p>

    <p>Each game reinforced different aspects of quantitative finance, from the mathematical rigor of probability calibration to the practical challenges of managing risk in live trading environments. The competition format also highlighted the importance of mental flexibility—switching between different modes of thinking as the games progressed.</p>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>Placing in the top 5 across all games was a validation of the interdisciplinary approach I've taken to quantitative finance. The competition demonstrated that success in this field requires not just technical skills, but also the ability to adapt strategies, manage risk, and make decisions under pressure.</p>

    <p>I'm grateful for the opportunity to compete alongside talented participants and to test my skills in such a comprehensive format. Competitions like this are invaluable for pushing boundaries and identifying areas for continued growth.</p>
