    <h2>Moderating Reinforcement Learning in Finance Panel at AICAF 2024</h2>
    <p><em>Published on May 18, 2024</em></p>

    <p>At AICAF'24 (AI in Computational Finance), I had the opportunity to moderate a panel on Reinforcement Learning in Finance—a topic at the intersection of my research interests in quantitative finance and machine learning. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, as I facilitated discussions among leading researchers and practitioners about the current state and future of RL in financial applications.</p>

    <h3>About AICAF</h3>
    <p>AICAF (AI in Computational Finance) is a conference that brings together researchers, practitioners, and students working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and finance. The conference covers topics ranging from algorithmic trading and risk management to market microstructure and regulatory technology.</p>

    <p>The conference provides a platform for discussing cutting-edge research, sharing practical insights, and networking with professionals across academia and industry.</p>

    <h3>The Panel: Reinforcement Learning in Finance</h3>
    <p>Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequential decision-making in finance. The panel explored several key areas:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li><strong>Algorithmic Trading:</strong> Using RL agents to learn optimal trading strategies</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio Optimization:</strong> Dynamic portfolio management with RL</li>
      <li><strong>Market Making:</strong> RL approaches to liquidity provision and inventory management</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Adaptive risk control using reinforcement learning</li>
      <li><strong>Challenges and Limitations:</strong> Addressing issues like non-stationarity, data scarcity, and interpretability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Discussion Points</h3>
    <p>As moderator, I guided discussions on several critical topics:</p>

    <p><strong>1. Non-Stationarity in Financial Markets:</strong> Financial markets are inherently non-stationary—the distribution of returns changes over time. This poses significant challenges for RL algorithms trained on historical data. Panelists discussed approaches to address this, including online learning, distributional shift detection, and robust policy design.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Sample Efficiency:</strong> Financial data is expensive and limited compared to domains like games or robotics. Panelists explored techniques for improving sample efficiency, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and simulation-based training.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Interpretability and Regulation:</strong> Financial applications often require interpretable models for regulatory compliance and risk management. The panel discussed methods for making RL policies more interpretable while maintaining performance.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Real-World Deployment:</strong> Moving from research to production involves numerous challenges. Panelists shared experiences with deploying RL systems in live trading environments, including considerations around latency, risk limits, and monitoring.</p>

    <h3>Moderating Experience</h3>
    <p>Moderating the panel required balancing multiple objectives:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li>Ensuring all panelists had opportunities to share their perspectives</li>
      <li>Facilitating engaging discussions that went beyond surface-level topics</li>
      <li>Managing time effectively while allowing for audience questions</li>
      <li>Connecting different panelists' contributions to create a coherent narrative</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Preparing for the panel involved researching each panelist's work, understanding their perspectives, and developing questions that would elicit insightful discussions. The goal was to create a conversation that would be valuable for both experts and those newer to the field.</p>

    <h3>Volunteering at the Conference</h3>
    <p>Beyond moderating the panel, I also volunteered for other parts of the conference. This included helping with registration, assisting with technical setup for talks, and facilitating networking sessions. Volunteering provided a different perspective on conference organization and allowed me to contribute to the broader AICAF community.</p>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <p>The panel reinforced several important points about RL in finance:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li>RL has significant potential but requires careful consideration of financial market characteristics</li>
      <li>Success requires combining RL techniques with domain expertise in finance</li>
      <li>Interpretability and risk management are critical for real-world deployment</li>
      <li>The field is rapidly evolving with new techniques and applications emerging regularly</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>Moderating the panel at AICAF'24 was a valuable learning experience. It pushed me to think deeply about RL in finance from multiple perspectives and to facilitate discussions that would benefit the broader community.</p>

    <p>The conference highlighted the vibrant research community working at the intersection of AI and finance. Being part of these discussions, both as a moderator and volunteer, reinforced my commitment to contributing to this field.</p>

    <p>I'm grateful for the opportunity to moderate the panel and to contribute to AICAF'24. The experience has informed my own research and provided valuable connections with other researchers and practitioners in the field.</p>
