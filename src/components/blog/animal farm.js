    <h2>Animal Farm : Book Review</h2>
    <p><em>Published on November 29, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      <strong>Animal Farm</strong> by George Orwell looks like a simple story about talking animals on a farm,
      but underneath that, it is a sharp political satire about power, corruption, and how revolutions can
      betray their own ideals. In this blog, I’ll walk through the main plot of the book and show how an
      inspiring rebellion slowly turns into a nightmare that looks very much like the past the animals tried to escape.
    </p>

    <h3>The Dream of Freedom</h3>
    <p>
      The story begins at <strong>Manor Farm</strong>, where the animals live under the control of a careless,
      often drunk farmer named <strong>Mr. Jones</strong>. One night, an old boar called <strong>Old Major</strong>
      gathers the animals and shares his dream: a world where animals run the farm themselves, without human masters.
      He teaches them a revolutionary song and plants the idea that they deserve better than a life of hunger and hard work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shortly after Old Major dies, the animals—energized by his message—rise up against Mr. Jones,
      drive him off the farm, and rename the place <strong>Animal Farm</strong>. For a brief moment, it feels like
      the beginning of a golden age.
    </p>

    <h3>Animal Farm and the Promise of Equality</h3>
    <p>
      After the rebellion, the animals create a set of rules known as the
      <strong>Seven Commandments</strong>, painted on the barn wall. The core idea is simple:
      “All animals are equal.” The pigs, who are seen as the smartest animals, naturally step into
      leadership roles. Two pigs in particular, <strong>Snowball</strong> and <strong>Napoleon</strong>,
      become the main leaders.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, things look hopeful. Snowball organizes committees and tries to educate every animal.
      The animals work hard, but the work feels meaningful now that they are working for themselves,
      not for a human farmer. Harvests improve, morale is high, and the farm seems to prove that animals
      can run things better than humans.
    </p>

    <h3>The Power Struggle: Snowball vs. Napoleon</h3>
    <p>
      As time goes on, a power struggle develops between Snowball and Napoleon. Snowball wants to modernize
      the farm and proposes building a <strong>windmill</strong> to generate electricity and make everyone’s
      lives easier. Napoleon is against the idea and focuses more on building his own power base.
    </p>

    <p>
      The turning point comes when the two pigs clash publicly over the windmill plan. In the middle of a heated
      debate, Napoleon gives a signal, and a pack of fierce dogs—secretly raised and trained by him—chase Snowball
      off the farm. Snowball disappears, and Napoleon seizes complete control.
    </p>

    <h3>The Rise of a New Tyranny</h3>
    <p>
      With Snowball gone, Napoleon declares himself the leader of Animal Farm. From this point on, the
      original ideals of the revolution begin to crumble. A pig named <strong>Squealer</strong> becomes
      Napoleon’s mouthpiece, constantly twisting facts and rewriting history so that Napoleon always looks right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Napoleon suddenly supports building the windmill—the very idea he once opposed—and claims it was his
      plan all along. Whenever things go wrong, Snowball, now a convenient scapegoat, is blamed for sabotage.
      The animals work harder than ever, often hungry and exhausted, but are told that life is better than it
      was under Mr. Jones.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing Rules and Broken Promises</h3>
    <p>
      Slowly, the pigs begin to break the original commandments:
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 20px; list-style: disc;">
      <li>They start sleeping in beds.</li>
      <li>They drink alcohol.</li>
      <li>They trade with humans.</li>
      <li>They give themselves special rations and comforts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each time, Squealer quietly alters the written commandments on the barn to make it seem as though nothing
      has been broken. The animals doubt their own memories and accept the new version of the rules because they
      have no real power and little education.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most heartbreaking example of this corruption is the fate of <strong>Boxer</strong>, the loyal and
      hardworking cart-horse. Boxer’s mottos—“I will work harder” and “Napoleon is always right”—symbolize the
      blind trust of ordinary workers. When he grows too old and weak to work, the pigs send him not to a
      promised retirement, but to the knacker to be slaughtered, in exchange for money to buy whisky.
    </p>

    <h3>“Some Animals Are More Equal Than Others”</h3>
    <p>
      Over time, the pigs become indistinguishable from the human farmers they once denounced. They walk on
      two legs, wear clothes, and carry whips. The Seven Commandments are eventually erased and replaced with
      a single chilling line:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0;">
      All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the final scene, the other animals peer through a farmhouse window and watch the pigs drinking and
      playing cards with nearby human farmers. As they look from pig to man and man to pig, they realize they
      can no longer tell the difference between them.
    </p>

    <h3>Why This Story Still Matters</h3>
    <p>
      The plot of <strong>Animal Farm</strong> shows how easily noble ideas can be twisted when power is placed
      in the hands of a few. What began as a revolution for equality ends as a dictatorship built on fear,
      lies, and manipulation. The animals’ failure to question authority, remember their history, or share
      real power allows their leaders to slowly destroy everything they fought for.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is what makes <strong>Animal Farm</strong> feel timeless. It is not just a story about animals,
      but a warning about any society where power goes unchecked and people stop asking hard questions.
